\section{Introduction}
For the rest of this document we will give a short summary of every newly created test that will check if the new features work as we expected. These new additions include the two new contact types, being Daycare and PreSchool, new data formats, being JSON and HDF5 as well as global schemes that will be used by all students. There will also be a visual output for the data via QT and an improvement to the generation of the population by factoring in new parameters that will make the generation of the population more diverse, so that we can check even more parameters for their influence on the spread of diseases.
