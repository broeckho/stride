\section{Simulation Paper}
For the simulation paper, we had the following assignment distribution, and we chose to maintain this distribution for the reevaluation of the paper. Furthermore we will be writing the corresponding entry in the simulation paper, as we assume that you will know best what you did and why you did it, if it was your own assignment: \\
\begin{table}[h!]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{| l | r |}
	\hline
	1.1 & Evelien and Lars \\
	\hline
	1.2 & Frank Jan \\
	\hline
	1.3 & Benjamin \\
	\hline
	1.4 & Benjamin \\
	\hline
	2.1 & Benjamin \\
	\hline
	2.2 & Frank Jan \\
	\hline
	2.3 & Lars \\
	\hline
	3 & Evelien \\
	\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{distribution of assignments for the Simulation assignment.}
\end{table}

\section{Simulator Paper}
For the simulator paper, we distributed the assignments as described in the table below, we also chose to distribute the commenting and writing of tests to the person who made the assignment, as this person is most likely more knowledgeable in the weaknesses of his or her code and will most likely know best which segment does what. We do however intend to look at each others code, even though it might not be our assignment, in order to see whether there are any oversights.
\begin{table}[h!]
	\centering
	\begin{tabular}{| l | r |}
		\hline
		1.2.1 & Benjamin \\
		\hline
		1.2.2 json geogrid & Evelien and Lars \\
		\hline
		1.2.2 json household & Evelien \\
		\hline
		1.2.2 hdf5 & Benjamin \\
		\hline
		1.2.3 & Frank Jan \\
		\hline
		1.2.4 & Lars \\
		\hline
		1.2.5 & Lars \\
		\hline
		1.2.6 & Evelien \\
		\hline
	\end{tabular}
	\caption{distribution of assignments for the Simulator assignment.}
\end{table}

\section{User Manual}
Finally, the students who wrote the corresponding code, will write the entry for the user manual. The distribution will be as is listed below.
\begin{table}[h!]

	\begin{tabular}{| l | r |}
		\hline
		QT & Frank Jan \\
		\hline
		Json & Evelien and Lars \\

		hdf5 & Benjamin \\
		\hline
		1.2.5 & Lars \\
		\hline
		1.2.6 & Evelien \\
		\hline
